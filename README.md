I created this project to allow me to monitor specific processes on my computers. It is designed to support processes on a local machine (using the main app) and on remote machines (using the agent service). 

It is a work-in-progress and needs to be thoroughly tested.

<h3>Functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Define processes to be monitored</li>
  <li>Restart processes that are not running</li>
  <li>Monitoring of processes on remote machines</li>
  <li>Ability to send email notifications</li>
</ul>

Screenshots will be coming...
